# Session 14 Handoff: Sub-Agents Documentation and Configuration

## Session Overview
Session 14 focused on adding essential documentation and configuration for the sub-agents implementation, following a simplified approach to avoid unnecessary complexity.

## What Was Accomplished ✅

### 1. Created CLAUDE.md
- Project-specific rules and guidelines
- Sub-agent priorities (Fix tool execution → Symbol Contractor → Session Orchestrator → Context Guardian)
- Testing commands and common solutions
- Context allocation guidelines (50% max for agent pool)

### 2. Created SECURITY.md
- Basic authentication guidelines
- Input validation best practices
- SQL injection prevention
- Agent security isolation
- WebSocket security configuration
- Development vs production settings

### 3. Created config/config.yaml
- Complete server configuration
- Agent-specific settings with context allocations:
  - Symbol Contractor: 15%
  - Session Orchestrator: 20%
  - Context Guardian: 10%
- Performance targets (<200ms response time)
- Agent interaction settings

### 4. Updated Database Schema
- Added `agent_memory` table for agent learning
- Added `symbol_registry` table for naming consistency
- Created appropriate indexes for performance
- Both tables linked to sessions for proper cascade deletion

## Current State 🔍

### What's Working:
- Project builds successfully with new schema
- Configuration structure in place for agents
- Security guidelines documented
- Most tests passing (111/114)

### Minor Issues:
- 3 test failures (not related to our changes)
- Tool execution visibility still needs to be fixed (priority #1)

## GitHub Docker MCP Server Integration 🐙

Now that you have the GitHub Docker MCP server connected, you can:

1. **Create pull requests directly**:
   ```
   Use mcp__github__create_pull_request to create a PR for the sub-agents work
   ```

2. **Check existing issues**:
   ```
   Use mcp__github__list_issues to see if there are related issues
   ```

3. **Review code changes**:
   ```
   Use mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff to review changes
   ```

## Next Session Priorities 🎯

### Priority 1: Fix Tool Execution Visibility
Before implementing sub-agents, we must resolve why tool executions aren't appearing in the MCP Interaction Log. Use the debugging infrastructure from Session 13.

### Priority 2: Implement Base Agent Infrastructure
1. Create `/src/agents/base/Agent.ts` with simple interface
2. Create `/src/agents/SimpleAgentOrchestrator.ts` for sequential execution
3. Create `/src/agents/AgentMemory.ts` for basic SQL storage

### Priority 3: Implement First Agent (Symbol Contractor)
1. Create `/src/agents/SymbolContractor.ts`
2. Add MCP tool endpoints for symbol operations
3. Test with simple naming consistency checks

### Priority 4: WebSocket Integration
1. Add agent event types to WebSocket
2. Create agent activity stream
3. Update UI to show agent suggestions

## Key Decisions Made 💡

### Simplifications:
- ❌ No vector databases (use SQLite text search)
- ❌ No complex orchestration (sequential execution)
- ❌ No ML predictions (simple heuristics)
- ❌ No parallel execution initially
- ✅ Simple SQL queries for memory
- ✅ Read-only shared memory
- ✅ Basic logging and monitoring

### Architecture:
- Agents are stateless where possible
- All decisions logged to agent_memory
- Symbol registry is source of truth
- User approval for critical actions

## Testing Strategy 🧪

With the Playwright test infrastructure from Session 13:
1. Test tool execution first
2. Test agent memory persistence
3. Test symbol registry operations
4. Test agent suggestions in UI

## Quick Commands 📝

```bash
# Check if database migration needed
sqlite3 data/myworkflow.db ".schema" | grep -E "agent_memory|symbol_registry"

# Start development environment
npm run dev:all

# Run specific agent tests (when created)
npm test -- agents

# Check WebSocket events
docker-compose logs -f websocket-server | grep "agent"
```

## Success Metrics 📊
- [ ] Tool executions visible in MCP log
- [ ] Agent tables created in database
- [ ] Base agent infrastructure working
- [ ] Symbol Contractor suggesting names
- [ ] Agent decisions logged

## Notes for Next Session 📝
1. Start by verifying tool execution fix
2. Create minimal agent implementation
3. Focus on Symbol Contractor first
4. Keep implementations simple
5. Test each component thoroughly

The foundation is now in place for implementing the sub-agents system with a focus on simplicity and practical value.
