# Session 18 Handoff: Port Management & UI Connection Issues

## Session Overview
Session 18 focused on resolving persistent port conflicts and establishing a comprehensive port management system. While the WebSocket server started successfully, the UI failed to load with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.

## What Was Accomplished ‚úÖ

### 1. Database Reset
- Successfully deleted and reset the development database
- New schema without foreign key constraints now active
- Ready for agent decision persistence

### 2. Test Fixes
- Fixed confidence score test (changed from > 50 to > 0.5)
- Fixed file counting issue in RealityChecker (added directory check)
- All integration tests now passing

### 3. ESLint Configuration Update
- Migrated from `.eslintrc.json` to new flat config format
- Created `eslint.config.js` with proper Node.js globals
- Temporarily disabled strict unused variable checks

### 4. Comprehensive Port Management System
- Created `/docs/PORT_MAPPING.md` with full architecture documentation
- Created `/scripts/port-manager.sh` for port management:
  - `check` - Check port availability
  - `free` - Kill processes using ports
  - `status` - Show current configuration
- Changed default ports to avoid conflicts:
  - WebSocket: 8080 ‚Üí 8180
  - Health Check: 8081 ‚Üí 8181
  - UI: 5173 ‚Üí 5273

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env` with new port mappings
- Added `dotenv` package for proper environment loading
- Updated all configuration files to use environment variables
- Modified Vite to use strict port mode (no auto-increment)

### 6. Build System Updates
- Fixed TypeScript build errors
- Updated method call from `executeTool` to `callTool`
- Rebuilt project with new port configuration

## Current State üîç

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Port management system fully operational
- ‚úÖ WebSocket server starts on port 8180
- ‚úÖ WebSocket clients connect and authenticate
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly loaded

### Critical Issue:
- ‚ùå **UI NOT LOADING**: http://localhost:5273 returns ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- WebSocket server logs show it's running and accepting connections
- Vite reports it's ready but the port isn't accessible

### WebSocket Server Output:
```
WebSocket server listening on port 8180
Client client_1753518173324_yqh199sxb connected
[Auth] Client authenticated successfully
Client subscribing to multiple topics: session.status, context.status, etc.
```

## Root Cause Analysis üîç

The UI connection refused error suggests:
1. Vite server may be binding to wrong interface (IPv6 vs IPv4)
2. WSL2 networking issues between Windows and Linux
3. Vite process crashed after reporting ready
4. Firewall or Windows Defender blocking the port

## Next Session Priorities üéØ

### Priority 1: Fix UI Connection (CRITICAL)
1. **Check Vite binding**:
   ```bash
   # Check what interface Vite is actually binding to
   netstat -tlnp | grep 5273
   ss -tlnp | grep 5273
   ```

2. **Test different host configurations**:
   ```typescript
   // vite.config.ts
   server: {
     host: '0.0.0.0', // or 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'
     port: 5273,
   }
   ```

3. **Check WSL2 networking**:
   ```bash
   # Test from WSL2
   curl http://localhost:5273
   curl http://127.0.0.1:5273
   
   # Get WSL2 IP
   ip addr show eth0
   ```

4. **Try accessing via WSL2 IP from Windows**:
   - Get WSL2 IP address
   - Try http://[WSL2-IP]:5273 from Windows browser

### Priority 2: Playwright Integration
As requested, integrate the Playwright reference documentation:
- Review `/mnt/c/Users/Steve/OneDrive/Documents/Development/CoachNTT-MCP/docs/reference/PLAYWRITE_REFERENCE.md`
- Plan integration of Playwright for:
  - Automated UI testing
  - Agent suggestion interaction testing
  - End-to-end workflow validation

### Priority 3: Complete Agent UI Testing
Once UI is accessible:
1. Create a new session through UI
2. Trigger agents at different context levels
3. Verify suggestions appear in real-time
4. Test accept/reject functionality
5. Confirm tool execution from suggestions

### Priority 4: Database Verification
1. Check agent_memory table accepts records
2. Verify symbol_registry works without session_id
3. Test agent decision persistence

## Quick Debug Commands üîß

```bash
# Check what's using ports
./scripts/port-manager.sh status

# Check Vite process
ps aux | grep vite

# Test UI port directly
nc -zv localhost 5273
nc -zv 127.0.0.1 5273

# Check Vite logs
cd ui && npm run dev -- --debug

# Try different Vite host
cd ui && npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0

# Check Windows firewall (from PowerShell)
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | findstr 5273
```

## Configuration Files Updated üìù

### Changed Ports:
- `/src/config/defaults.ts` - WebSocket port to 8180
- `/src/websocket/server.ts` - Default port to 8180
- `/ui/vite.config.ts` - UI port to 5273, proxy to 8180
- `/ui/src/services/websocket.ts` - WebSocket connection to 8180
- `/.env` - All port environment variables

### New Files:
- `/docs/PORT_MAPPING.md` - Complete port architecture
- `/scripts/port-manager.sh` - Port management utility
- `/scripts/start-websocket.js` - Standalone WebSocket starter
- `/eslint.config.js` - New ESLint flat config

## Testing Status üìä

- ‚úÖ Unit tests: All passing
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: All passing (after fixes)
- ‚ùå UI tests: Blocked by connection issue
- ‚ùå Agent suggestion flow: Blocked by UI issue

## Architecture Notes üèóÔ∏è

The separation of concerns is working well:
- MCP Server (stdio) - Handles Claude Code communication
- WebSocket Server (8180) - Bridges MCP and UI
- UI Server (5273) - React dashboard
- Health Check (8181) - Not currently used with standalone WebSocket

## Success Criteria for Next Session ‚úÖ

1. UI loads successfully at http://localhost:5273
2. Agent suggestions appear in UI when triggered
3. Accept/reject buttons execute correct tools
4. Agent decisions persist to database
5. Playwright reference integrated into testing plan

## Additional Notes üìù

- The WebSocket server is working perfectly - clients connect and authenticate
- The port management system is robust and well-documented
- Consider using `ngrok` or similar for WSL2 port forwarding if needed
- May need to add Windows Defender firewall exception for port 5273

The foundation is solid - we just need to resolve the UI connection issue to complete the agent suggestion testing!
