# Session 20 Handoff: Docker Infrastructure Fixed & Operational

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Goal**: Fix Docker setup issues and test unified server with correct ports
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Major Fixes Implemented

### 1. Port Configuration Alignment
Fixed the port mismatch between `.env` (8180/8181/5273) and hardcoded values (8080/8081/5173):

#### Files Updated:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Now uses environment variables for all ports
- `ui/Dockerfile.dev` - Updated to expose port 5273
- `src/config/defaults.ts` - Changed default from 8080 to 8180
- `src/unified-server.ts` - Added MCP_HEALTH_PORT environment variable support
- `src/utils/websocket-broadcaster.ts` - Fixed hardcoded port 8080 → 8180
- `src/mcp-websocket-client.ts` - Updated default port to 8180
- `ui/src/services/websocket.ts` - Fixed to use VITE_WS_URL
- `.mcp.json` - Updated WebSocket URL to use port 8180

### 2. Port Manager Script Created
Implemented `/scripts/port-manager.sh` as documented in Session 18:
- `check` - Check if specific port is available
- `free` - Kill processes using ports (with confirmation)
- `status` - Show current configuration and availability
- Supports environment variables for port configuration

### 3. Docker Stack Operational

#### Current Status:
```
✅ WebSocket Server: Running on port 8180 (healthy)
✅ Health Check API: Running on port 8181 (responding)
✅ UI Dashboard: Running on port 5273 (accessible)
✅ MCP Bridge: Initialized with 31 tools registered
✅ No connection errors in logs
```

#### Key Success Indicators:
- Health endpoint returns all systems healthy
- UI loads without ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- WebSocket clients connecting successfully
- MCP tools registered in bridge
- No more "connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:8080" errors

## Testing Completed

### 1. Infrastructure Tests
- ✅ Port availability checked with port-manager.sh
- ✅ Docker containers built successfully
- ✅ All services started and healthy
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding
- ✅ UI accessible at http://localhost:5273

### 2. WebSocket Connectivity
- ✅ Fixed WebSocketBroadcaster connection issue
- ✅ Clients connecting and authenticating
- ✅ Subscriptions working (session.status, context.status, etc.)
- ✅ No reconnection loops in logs

### 3. MCP Preparation
- ✅ Updated .mcp.json configuration
- ✅ Created test-mcp-tools.md guide
- ✅ Verified tool registration in logs

## Architecture Validation

The unified server architecture is working as designed:
```
Docker Container (coachntt-websocket)
├── Unified Server Process
│   ├── MCP Server (internal, tools registered)
│   ├── WebSocket API (port 8180, accepting connections)
│   ├── Health Check API (port 8181, responding)
│   └── MCP-WebSocket Bridge (31 tools registered)
│
UI Container (coachntt-ui)
├── Vite Dev Server (port 5273)
└── React Dashboard (connected to WebSocket)
```

## Next Session Tasks

### Priority 1: Test Agent UI Flow (Session 18 Blocker Resolved!)
Now that the UI loads successfully:
1. Open http://localhost:5273 in browser
2. Create new session through UI
3. Monitor context usage gauge
4. Trigger agents at different thresholds:
   - 70% - Warning threshold
   - 85% - Critical threshold
5. Verify agent suggestions appear in UI
6. Test accept/reject functionality
7. Confirm decisions persist to agent_memory table

### Priority 2: Test MCP Tools via Claude Code
1. Restart Claude Code to load new .mcp.json
2. Test tools in order from test-mcp-tools.md:
   - health_check
   - session_start
   - session_status
   - context_status
   - agent_status
3. Monitor UI for real-time updates
4. Check WebSocket logs for tool execution events

### Priority 3: Playwright Integration Planning
1. Review `/docs/reference/PLAYWRITE_REFERENCE.md`
2. Design test scenarios:
   - UI interaction tests (session creation, navigation)
   - Agent suggestion flow tests
   - Tool execution verification
   - Real-time update validation
3. Create implementation plan
4. Consider Docker integration for Playwright

### Priority 4: Documentation Updates
1. Create migration guide from stdio to WebSocket
2. Update README with new port configuration
3. Document Docker-only deployment process
4. Add troubleshooting for common issues

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: WebSocketBroadcaster Connection Loop (FIXED)
- **Cause**: Hardcoded to port 8080 in constructor
- **Solution**: Updated to use MCP_WEBSOCKET_PORT env var
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: UI Connection Refused (FIXED)
- **Cause**: Port mismatch and missing environment variables
- **Solution**: Aligned all ports to use .env configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: Health Check Hardcoded Port (FIXED)
- **Cause**: Used websocket.port + 1 without env var
- **Solution**: Added MCP_HEALTH_PORT support
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check port status
./scripts/port-manager.sh status

# View container status
docker-compose ps

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8181/health

# View logs
docker logs coachntt-websocket --tail 50
docker logs coachntt-ui --tail 20

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Full rebuild
npm run build && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

## Session 20 Achievements

1. **Resolved all Session 18/19 blockers** - UI loads, ports aligned
2. **Created robust port management** - Script for conflict resolution
3. **Validated Docker architecture** - All components working together
4. **Prepared for agent testing** - Infrastructure ready for UI flow
5. **Set up MCP testing** - Configuration and guide ready

The Docker-only deployment with MCP-over-WebSocket bridge is now fully operational and ready for comprehensive testing!
