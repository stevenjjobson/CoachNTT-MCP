# Session 6 Continuation Prompt

Copy and paste the following prompt to begin Session 6:

---

I need to continue with Session 6 of the CoachNTT-MCP project. Please:

1. Review the Session 5 summary at `docs/planning/SESSION_5_SUMMARY.md` and documentation at `docs/reference/AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
2. Check current test failures with `npm test`
3. Fix remaining TypeScript and test issues

## Current State
- All core functionality implemented
- Configuration system complete
- Server with health checks ready
- Tests created but some failing due to:
  - RealityChecker test expecting properties not in interface
  - Database I/O errors in tests
  - Some TypeScript type mismatches

## Session 6 Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Test Issues (60% context)
- Fix RealityChecker test expectations to match actual interfaces
- Resolve database I/O errors (likely path issues)
- Fix TypeScript type mismatches in tests
- Ensure all tests pass

### 2. MCP Tool Integration (30% context)
- Verify all 19 MCP tools are properly connected
- Add any missing tool handlers
- Test tool integration end-to-end

### 3. Final Polish (10% context)
- Update documentation
- Add example usage
- Create deployment instructions

## Known Issues to Fix

### RealityChecker Tests
- Tests expect `check_id` but interface has `snapshot_id`
- Tests expect `auto_fixed` property that doesn't exist
- Tests expect different structure for validation response

### Database Tests
- Getting "disk I/O error" - need to ensure proper test database setup
- May need to adjust test database paths

### Type Mismatches
- `documentation_updated` being passed as boolean instead of number
- Missing type definitions for some test scenarios

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- TypeScript compilation clean
- All MCP tools integrated
- Ready for deployment

Let's start by running the tests to see current failures.
