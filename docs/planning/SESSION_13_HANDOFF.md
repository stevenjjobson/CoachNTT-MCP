# Session 13 Handoff: Tool Execution Debugging & Playwright Integration

## Session Overview

Session 13 focused on systematically debugging why UI buttons weren't triggering visible tool executions in the MCP Interaction Log. We implemented strategic logging, created debugging tools, and added console spam filtering.

## What Was Accomplished ‚úÖ

### 1. Created Playwright Test Infrastructure
- **File**: `/tests/playwright-ui-debug.ts`
- Comprehensive test script for automated UI debugging
- Structured approach to test each button systematically
- Can be expanded to use actual Playwright MCP server

### 2. Added Strategic Logging Throughout
- **QuickActions.tsx**: Added detailed logging for button clicks
- **SessionOverview.tsx**: Already had logging, verified working
- **ContextMonitor.tsx**: Added logging for optimize button
- **RealityCheck.tsx**: Added logging for run check button
- **WebSocket Service**: Added special markers for tool execution events
- **MCP Tools Service**: Already had logging in place

### 3. Created Debug Test Page
- **File**: `/test-tool-execution-debug.html`
- Standalone HTML page to test WebSocket tool execution
- Bypasses React UI to isolate WebSocket communication
- Includes session creation and all tool testing

### 4. Implemented Console Spam Filtering
- **File**: `/ui/src/utils/log-filter.ts`
- Three log levels: verbose, normal, quiet
- Filters session.status messages by default
- Always shows tool executions and errors
- Stores preference in localStorage

### 5. Fixed UI Build Error
- Fixed TypeScript error in MCPInteractionLog component
- Removed unnecessary type casting

## Current State üîç

### What's Working:
- UI loads and displays data correctly
- WebSocket connection and authentication work
- Session creation works
- Context Monitor and Project Tracker show real data
- Tool execution infrastructure is in place
- Console spam is now manageable with filtering

### What Still Needs Investigation:
1. **Tool Execution Flow**: Need to verify if:
   - Button clicks are reaching handleAction methods
   - MCPTools.callTool is being invoked
   - WebSocket.executeTool is sending messages
   - Server is receiving and processing tool requests
   - tool:execution events are being broadcast back

2. **MCP Interaction Log**: Still shows "No tool executions yet"

## Debugging Steps for Next Session

### 1. Use the Debug HTML Page
```bash
# Open in browser
file:///mnt/c/Users/Steve/OneDrive/Documents/Development/CoachNTT-MCP/test-tool-execution-debug.html

# Steps:
1. Click Connect
2. Click Start Session
3. Click Test Checkpoint
4. Check if tool:execution events appear
```

### 2. Check Console Output
With the new logging in place, the console should show:
```
[QuickActions] Button clicked: checkpoint
[QuickActions] Executing action checkpoint for session xxx
[QuickActions] Creating checkpoint with params: {...}
[MCPTools] Creating checkpoint: {...}
[WebSocket] üéØ SENDING TOOL EXECUTION: {...}
[WebSocket] üìã Tool execution result: {...}
[WebSocket] üéØ TOOL EXECUTION EVENT RECEIVED: {...}
```

### 3. Verify Server Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f websocket-server | grep -E "(tool|execution|Tool)"
```

### 4. If Tool Execution Events Not Appearing
The issue might be:
- Server not emitting events after tool execution
- Broadcast not reaching subscribed clients
- Client not properly subscribed to tool:execution topic

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start everything fresh
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
cd ui && npm run dev

# Watch WebSocket server logs
docker-compose logs -f websocket-server

# Rebuild after backend changes
npm run build
docker cp dist/. coachntt-websocket:/app/dist/
docker-compose restart websocket-server

# Change log level in browser console
localStorage.setItem('coachntt-log-level', 'verbose')  # See everything
localStorage.setItem('coachntt-log-level', 'normal')   # Default
localStorage.setItem('coachntt-log-level', 'quiet')    # Minimal logs
```

## Playwright Integration (Future)

The Playwright MCP server can be used to:
1. Automatically navigate to the UI
2. Click buttons programmatically
3. Capture console logs without manual inspection
4. Take screenshots at each step
5. Monitor WebSocket traffic

Example usage:
```typescript
// Navigate to UI
await playwright.browser_navigate({ url: 'http://localhost:5173' });

// Take snapshot
const snapshot = await playwright.browser_snapshot({});

// Find and click checkpoint button
const button = findElement(snapshot, 'Checkpoint');
await playwright.browser_click({ 
  element: 'Checkpoint button',
  ref: button.ref 
});

// Capture console logs
const logs = await playwright.browser_console_messages({});
```

## Files Modified

```
/tests/playwright-ui-debug.ts                 - NEW: Playwright test framework
/test-tool-execution-debug.html               - NEW: Standalone debug page
/ui/src/utils/log-filter.ts                  - NEW: Console spam filtering
/ui/src/components/QuickActions.tsx          - Added detailed logging
/ui/src/components/ContextMonitor.tsx        - Added optimize logging
/ui/src/components/RealityCheck.tsx          - Added check logging
/ui/src/services/websocket.ts                - Added filtered logging
/ui/src/store/dashboard-context.tsx          - Added filtered logging
/ui/src/components/MCPInteractionLog.tsx     - Fixed TypeScript error
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Tool Execution Path**
   - Use debug page to test raw WebSocket communication
   - Check if server is broadcasting tool:execution events
   - Verify UI is receiving and displaying events

2. **Complete Playwright Integration**
   - Set up actual Playwright MCP server connection
   - Create automated test suite
   - Add to CI/CD pipeline

3. **Fix Any Remaining Issues**
   - Based on debug findings, fix the broken link in the chain
   - Ensure MCP Interaction Log updates in real-time

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All UI buttons trigger visible entries in MCP Interaction Log
- [ ] Console spam is manageable (no continuous session.status logs)
- [ ] Tool execution events show parameters and results
- [ ] Playwright can automatically test all UI functionality
