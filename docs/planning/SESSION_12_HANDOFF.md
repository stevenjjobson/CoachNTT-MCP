# Session 12 Handoff: UI Data Display & MCP Integration Attempts

## Session Summary

### What Was Actually Fixed ✅
1. **Context Monitor Now Shows Real Data**
   - Was showing: "Context usage will appear here when a session is active"
   - Now shows: Actual token usage (0/10,000)
   - Fix: Added immediate data send on subscription in `/src/websocket/server.ts`

2. **Project Tracker Now Shows Real Data**
   - Was showing: "Project metrics will appear here when a session is active"
   - Now shows: Actual project metrics
   - Fix: Added immediate data send on subscription and null array handling

3. **UI Crash Fixed**
   - Error: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')"
   - Cause: `project.common_blockers` was null
   - Fix: Added null checks in UI and return empty arrays from backend

4. **WebSocket Broadcasting Infrastructure**
   - Created `/src/utils/websocket-broadcaster.ts`
   - Connected MCP server to WebSocket for tool broadcasts
   - Added tool:execution subscription handling

### What's Still Broken ❌
1. **MCP Interaction Log Shows Nothing**
   - UI buttons (Checkpoint, Run Check, Optimize) don't execute tools
   - Tool execution events not being received despite infrastructure
   - Multiple tool results in console but no visible effect

2. **Console Spam**
   - Session status updates flooding console continuously
   - Makes debugging nearly impossible
   - Attempted fixes didn't work properly

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - Vite keeps detecting port 5173 as in use
   - Requires sudo to kill zombie processes
   - Currently running on port 5174

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Vite Port Management
- Port 5173 had zombie processes that required sudo to kill
- Vite's port detection is overly cautious
- Solution: Set `strictPort: false` to allow fallback ports

### Failed Debug System
- Attempted to add debug.ts utility to control logging
- Caused UI to completely fail to load
- Rolled back but wasted significant time

## Current State

### UI Status
- Dev server: **http://localhost:5174/** (not 5173!)
- Docker containers: Running
- WebSocket: Connected and authenticated
- Data display: Working for Context and Project
- Tool execution: NOT WORKING

### Key Files Modified
```
/src/websocket/server.ts          - Added initial data send, tool:execution handling
/src/managers/ProjectTracker.ts   - Fixed null array returns
/src/managers/ContextMonitor.ts   - Removed duplicate observable updates
/ui/src/components/ProjectTracker.tsx - Added null checks
/ui/src/services/mcp-tools.ts     - Updated parameter names
/ui/src/services/websocket.ts     - Added tool:execution subscription
/ui/vite.config.ts               - Set strictPort: false
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start everything
docker-compose up -d
cd ui && npm run dev

# If port 5173 is stuck (requires sudo)
sudo lsof -i :5173
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Check WebSocket logs
docker-compose logs -f websocket-server

# Restart WebSocket server after changes
npm run build
docker cp dist/. coachntt-websocket:/app/dist/
docker-compose restart websocket-server
```

## Immediate Next Steps (Session 13)

### 1. Fix Tool Execution (CRITICAL)
The infrastructure is all there but tools aren't executing:
- Add console.log at EVERY step of the execution chain
- Verify the click handlers are actually being called
- Check if WebSocket messages are being sent
- Trace through the entire flow

### 2. Reduce Console Spam
- Implement proper log filtering that works
- Consider environment variable for log level
- Make session status updates opt-in only

### 3. Debug Tool Flow
The execution chain should be:
```
Button Click → handleCheckpoint() → tools.createCheckpoint() 
→ ws.executeTool() → WebSocket 'execute' message 
→ Server ToolExecutionHandler → emit 'tool:execution' 
→ Broadcast to clients → Update MCP log
```

## Test Tools Available
- Main UI: http://localhost:5174/
- Tool test page: `file:///mnt/c/Users/Steve/OneDrive/Documents/Development/CoachNTT-MCP/test-tool-execution.html`
- Context/Project test: `file:///mnt/c/Users/Steve/OneDrive/Documents/Development/CoachNTT-MCP/test-context-project.html`

## Session Metrics
- Context used: ~87% of window
- Time spent debugging: ~2 hours
- User frustration level: High (understandably)

## Critical Note for Next Session
The user is frustrated with the lack of progress on tool execution. Focus ONLY on getting buttons to execute tools and show in the MCP log. Everything else is secondary.
