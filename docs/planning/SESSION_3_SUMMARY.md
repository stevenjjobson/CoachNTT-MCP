# Session 3 Summary

## Overview
Session 3 successfully implemented the ContextMonitor and RealityChecker managers, completing core context tracking and validation functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ContextMonitor Implementation (~555 lines)
- ✅ Implemented `trackUsage()` method with database persistence
- ✅ Created `getStatus()` with real-time analytics and trend detection
- ✅ Implemented `predict()` for usage forecasting and task feasibility
- ✅ Built `optimize()` with multi-level optimization strategies
- ✅ Added `getAnalytics()` for detailed usage metrics
- ✅ Integrated with SessionManager for automatic tracking
- ✅ Observable patterns for real-time UI updates

### 2. RealityChecker Implementation (~604 lines)
- ✅ Implemented `performCheck()` with comprehensive validation
- ✅ Created file system, test, and documentation checks
- ✅ Built `validateMetrics()` for metric accuracy verification
- ✅ Implemented `applyFixes()` with auto-fix capabilities
- ✅ Added confidence scoring and recommendations
- ✅ Database persistence for reality snapshots

### 3. Integration Work
- ✅ Connected ContextMonitor to SessionManager's checkpoint creation
- ✅ Fixed async transaction issues in SessionManager
- ✅ Verified all MCP tool handlers are properly wired
- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite for ContextMonitor (262 lines)

### 4. Key Technical Decisions
- Used database row format for session data to avoid object mapping issues
- Implemented transaction-safe context tracking with async operations outside transactions
- Created sensitive trend detection for better context monitoring
- Added phase-based allocation estimates for budget tracking

## Metrics
- **Lines Written**: ~1,421 (555 + 604 + 262)
- **Tests Created**: 16 passing tests for ContextMonitor
- **Integration Points**: 3 (SessionManager, Database, MCP tools)
- **Context Usage**: Approximately 40% of allocated budget

## Database Enhancements
- Properly utilized `context_usage` table for tracking
- Added support for `reality_snapshots` table
- Maintained transaction integrity across operations

## Observable Patterns
- ContextMonitor emits real-time status updates
- RealityChecker tracks active discrepancies
- All managers follow consistent Observable patterns

## Next Session Recommendations

### Priority 1: DocumentationEngine Implementation
- Implement template-based documentation generation
- Create update mechanisms for existing docs
- Add synchronization checking

### Priority 2: ProjectTracker Implementation
- Build velocity tracking and analysis
- Implement blocker management
- Create progress reporting

### Priority 3: Enhanced Testing
- Add tests for RealityChecker
- Create integration tests for tool handlers
- Test WebSocket functionality

### Priority 4: UI Integration Preparation
- Implement WebSocket server setup
- Create real-time event streaming
- Build subscription management

## Technical Debt
- Consider extracting common database patterns
- Optimize context usage calculations for large sessions
- Add more granular error handling in reality checks

## Context Management
- Current implementation tracks usage accurately
- Prediction engine helps prevent context exhaustion
- Optimization strategies provide actionable recommendations

## Quality Indicators
- All ContextMonitor tests passing
- Clean integration with existing managers
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Files Modified/Created
1. `/src/managers/ContextMonitor.ts` - Full implementation
2. `/src/managers/RealityChecker.ts` - Full implementation
3. `/src/managers/SessionManager.ts` - Integration updates
4. `/tests/ContextMonitor.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
5. `/src/core/tools.ts` - Already had tool handlers wired

## Session 3 successfully established the context monitoring and reality checking infrastructure, providing a solid foundation for AI-assisted development workflow management.
