Copy and paste the following prompt to continue development:

---

I need to continue the CoachNTT-MCP project. Please:

1. Review the session plan at `docs/planning/SESSION_1_PLAN.md`
2. Review the AI quick reference at `docs/reference/AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
3. Check the project structure with `ls -la`

Current state:
- Documentation complete (~5,900 lines)
- All interfaces and specifications documented
- Ready for implementation

Please begin Session 1 focusing on:
- Initialize TypeScript project with MCP SDK
- Create all interface files from the reference
- Implement core MCP server structure
- Set up SQLite database with all schemas

Remember to:
- Follow the exact interface definitions from AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Use the correct MCP handler patterns documented
- Monitor context usage (60% budget for Session 1)
- Create checkpoints at natural boundaries

Let's start with project initialization and core interfaces.
