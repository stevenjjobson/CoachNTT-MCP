# Session 20 Compact Summary: Docker Infrastructure Fixed

## What We Did
Fixed all Docker port configuration issues and got the unified server fully operational.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Port Alignment (8180/8181/5273)
- Updated docker-compose.yml to use environment variables
- Fixed WebSocketBroadcaster hardcoded to 8080
- Updated all configuration files and documentation

### 2. Created Port Manager
```bash
./scripts/port-manager.sh status  # Check ports
./scripts/port-manager.sh free    # Free ports
```

### 3. Docker Stack Working
```
✅ WebSocket: localhost:8180
✅ Health API: localhost:8181  
✅ UI Dashboard: localhost:5273
✅ MCP Bridge: 31 tools registered
```

## Quick Test
```bash
# Check everything
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:8181/health

# View UI
http://localhost:5273
```
